- Target
With the launch of RocketMQ 5.0 architecture, the RocketMQ Dashboard has not been well adapted to RocketMQ 5.0. There have been issues with Dashboard being unable to create various themes for V5, lack of support for Proxy components, and incorrect master-slave synchronization metrics. Therefore, we need to adapt the RocketMQ Dashboard to the RocketMQ 5.0 architecture in this project to enhance its usability.
